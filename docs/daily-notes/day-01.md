# Day 1: Setup + Tailwind + Baseline Layout
## What I Built
- Created React app with Vite
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS
- Set up ESLint and Prettier
- Built a basic layout with header, sidebar, and main content
## What I Learned
- Vite is much faster than Create React App
- Tailwind uses utility classes instead of writing custom CSS
- TypeScript helps catch errors early
- Layout component accepts children prop (like RenderFragment in Blazor)
## Problem Faced 
- PowerShell execution policy error: npm.ps1 was blocked because script execution was disabled in PowerShell on Windows.

- TypeScript type-only import error: ReactNode caused an error due to verbatimModuleSyntax being enabled, requiring a type-only import.
## Tomorrow
- Build reusable UI components (Button, Input, Card, Modal)
