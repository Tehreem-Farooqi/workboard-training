# Day 2: React Fundamentals - Components and Hooks
## What I Built
- Button component with variants (primary, secondary, danger)
- Input component with labels and error states
- Card component for content containers
- Modal with keyboard support (Escape to close)
- Toast notification system
- Skeleton loading components
## What I Learned
- **Props**: Like [Parameter] in Blazor - pass data to components
- **useState**: Like @code state fields in Blazor
- **useEffect**: Like OnInitialized/OnAfterRender in Blazor
- **forwardRef**: Needed for Input to work with forms later
- **Children prop**: Like RenderFragment in Blazor
- **Controlled inputs**: React controls the input value via state
## Key Concepts
- Components are just functions that return JSX
- State changes trigger re-renders
- Props flow down, events flow up
- Side effects go in useEffect
## Tomorrow
- React Router for navigation
- Protected routes
